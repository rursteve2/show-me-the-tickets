# Show me the tickets!

This is an application that uses a json data set, and displays event information based on user input.

The homepage displays all events by Elton John.
Selecting a city in the dropdown list gives you only those cities that Elton John performs in.
Selecting an event gives you more information, such as venue, venue size, price, date, etc.

# Part 3
Some possible reasons the filter implemented did not help customer experience may be that rather than a specified city, customers may have wanted to filter it by date, due to availability. It is also possible that customers wanted to be able to see certain details, such as whether it is about to sell out without having to check each and every listing.

I can add more filters, and more basic data to inform customers of possible sales or availability to improve user experience, rather than users checking listings for details. I also believe I can make it more visual, such as adding a map to filter by location rather than a dropdown filter.
